      <div class="carrier">
        <p>
          I’ve been in the software industry for almost twenty years, working in
          both high pressure startups and big corporate machines. My career has
          been a set of fits and starts, great decisions, backwards movement,
          getting places due to luck and making my own luck with careful,
          considered judgement. A few days ago, an intern I was mentoring asked
          me to tell them how your software career develops, and I realised that
          nobody had told me this — and that I’ve had to pick it all up as I go
          along. So to give you a headstart in the software industry, here is
          what I’ve learned in the process:
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re following a developer career path, there are three phases to
          your career
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="junior">
          Junior Developer (The more enlightened companies will drop the term
          ‘Junior’ and call Junior Developers ‘Developers’ or ‘Engineer 1’).
          This role is where you begin your career. You’re expected to know how
          to code, but you’re not expected to have learned how to code as part
          of a team yet. You don’t have the experience to know why some of the
          best practices exist, and it may turn out you are totally
          inexperienced with a tool which more senior developers have forgotten
          they ever had to learn.Проверка шрифта roboto.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tasks">
        <p>
          In this role you’re generally going to start out by being given work
          to do, in order to train you up. Over time, you’ll begin to notice
          problems that underly the tasks you’re given, and you will start to
          suggest how to improve things — but rarely will you be able to make
          the decision to fix these things without discussion with a more senior
          engineer. The aim, at the start of your career should be to get
          ownership of some part of the codebase — become the go-to person when
          there are problems in a particular feature or area of code. This
          establishes you as someone who is unique and reliable.
        </p>
        <p class="advantages">
          As a Junior developer you have a few advantages over some of the
          people who have been around longer — you’ll know about new tools,
          languages and techniques which have passed more senior developers by.
          This is also the time in your career when you’ll get to do the most
          coding — as you’re not yet caught up in the world of meetings and
          process, and you’re still not heavily involved in system design and
          architecture
        </p>
        <p>
          Senior Developer is the next role. As a junior developer your
          essential value is how much high quality code you can produce in a
          day. Over time, you stop becoming more efficient, because you’ve
          learned how everything works, and know all the productivity tricks
          which make you more effective. Once you’re not getting much more
          efficient, why would a company want to keep increasing your salary?
          The answer: You have to begin to make other people more efficient.

            When you become a senior developer you take on a few new roles:
          </h3>
          <br />
          <ul class="senior-tasks">
            <li>
              Helping the junior developers: All that knowledge you picked up in
              the first few years of your career? Well, now its your turn to
              share that know how with the new developers the company has hired.
              The faster the new junior developers grow, the more valuable they
              become to the company — and you’re the person best placed to help.
            </li>
            <li class="communication">
              Communicating with management: By now you know what needs to be
              done, and where the problems are in the code base that the
              non-technical observer may not see. You’ll begin to make
              suggestions to management as to what they should be prioritising
              (and you’ll begin to run head first into the brick walls of
              corporate politics at the same time). You’re also going to be
              better at recognising what tasks are easy and what tasks are
              nearly impossible — and again you’ll be feeding that back in
              planning sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design: You’ll begin to design larger and more critical parts of
              the code — perhaps entire features which will be implemented by
              several people. You’ll also begin to have to cope when your
              designs are criticised, and when their implementation introduces
              new and unexpected difficulties.
            </li>
            <li class="design">
              Leadership: The junior developers will look up to you as someone
              who knows what they are doing. And you may be asked to run small
              teams of engineers working on a feature or tracking down a
              particularly gnarly problem. In the process, you’ll have to
              convince people to work with you, even though you have no
              significant authority. Generally speaking, your technical
              knowledge becomes the best lever you have in these situations.
